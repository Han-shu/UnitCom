# Result Description
- 2024-10-18 (presented on INFORMS)
    - VOLL = 5,000, solar*1, wind*1
    - cost = ThreePartCost(gen_cost.COST_1, gen_cost.COST_0, genprop.PERC_StartUpCost, 0.0)
- Before 2024-11-19
    - Storage SOC is not initialized correctly in INFORMS results, leading to the high profits and same profits per MW for BA and PH
    - After correcting the SOC initialization, BA and PH are not working as expected
    - From results between 2024-11-15 and 2024-11-18, I found the residual value (dual of storage soc transition) used in the objective of ED is negative. Hence, BA and PH always discharge
    - 2024-11-15: consider variable cost in UC, no start-up cost, no-load cost
    - 2024-11-16: Remove minup and mindown constraints
    - 2024-11-17: Initialize eb_t0 in UC and ED
    - 2024-11-18: Remove storage 
- 2024-11-19
    - Change the sign of residual value of storage in ED objective function
    - Constant imports 2900 MW in UC and ED
    - Results: PH is always at low SOC
- 2024-12-01
    - Add imports supply curve as in add_imports.jl
    - Add residual value for PH in UC 
    - Results: Better PH action, PH is more profitable (per unit) than BA
- 2024-12-03
    - Overestimate the residual value
    - ED obj: storage_value[b]*12 -> storage_value[b]

# Storage Capacity
"In 2019, New York passed the nation-leading Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act), which codified some of the most aggressive energy and climate goals in the country, including 1,500 MW of energy storage by 2025 and 3,000 MW by 2030. In June 2024, New Yorkâ€™s Public Service Commission expanded the goal to 6,000 MW by 2030." (https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Energy-Storage-Program)
- PH => Pumped hydro (treat as 10h battery): 1170 MWh
    approximately how many cycles the Blenheim-Gilboa plant has per year
    281.7 GWh/(10 hrs*1160 MW)=24 cycles
- BA => 4h battery: 1500 MWh


# Limitations
- Reserve qualification
    - Spinning reserve: Online thermal generators and all batteries
    - Non-spinning reserve: Offline fast-start thermal generators (min up time <= 1 hr)
    - Thermal generators are not allowed to provide any reserve
- Variable cost of thermal generators is assumed to be constant
- No minimum run time and notification time
- Hydro power plants are modeled by SingleTimeSeries historical dispatch

# Problems
- RLMP (fix integer variables) v.s. ELMP (relax integer variables)

# NY Grid TODO
- [NY_Sienna_Conversion](https://github.com/gackermannlogan/NY_Sienna_Conversion)
- Thermal Generators operation cost 
    - Heat rate, TwoPartCost, ThreePartCost, MarketBids?
    - ThreePartCost: Fixed cost, variable cost, and start-up cost
    - Need: start-up
            shut-down = 0 or 0.2*start_up 
    - heat rate * fuel cost
    - differenciate nuclear, thermal_st, thermal
- Update to be compatible with the latest version of PowerSystems.jl
