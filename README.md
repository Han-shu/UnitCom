# TODO
- function _extract_fcst_matrix: ~~_read_h5_file: attach scenarios 2:12 time series~~
- function _extract_fcst_matrix: ~~UC: Use from 2nd time point, ED: Use from 1st time point~~
- Battery qualification for the new product
- New reserve product requirement
    - Fixed reserve (FR)
    - Dynamic reserve (DR)
- Add model configuration for different policies (SB, NR, BNR, FR, DR)
- No need: Deterministic model: attach one scenario time series according to theta


# Storage Capacity
"In 2019, New York passed the nation-leading Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (Climate Act), which codified some of the most aggressive energy and climate goals in the country, including 1,500 MW of energy storage by 2025 and 3,000 MW by 2030. In June 2024, New Yorkâ€™s Public Service Commission expanded the goal to 6,000 MW by 2030." (https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Energy-Storage-Program)
- Pumped hydro (treat as 10h battery): 1170 MWh
- 4h battery: 1500 MWh

# September 20 2024, meeting
- Update data
- Add solar/wind/hydro profits
- Add curtailment 
- Stochastic without reserve
- 50 percentile of the net load or 50 percentile load and 50 percentile solar/wind respectively
- Reserve tunning (new product to address forecast error)


# Limitations
- All thermal generators and batteries are assumed to be eligible to provide reserve
- Reserve is provided by thermal generators and batteries only
- Variable cost of thermal generators is assumed to be constant
- No minimum run time and notification time
- Hydro power plants are modeled by SingleTimeSeries historical dispatch

# Problems
- UC infeasibility if starting from existing solution files
- RLMP (fix integer variables) v.s. ELMP (relax integer variables)

# Log

# NY Grid TODO
- [NY_Sienna_Conversion](https://github.com/gackermannlogan/NY_Sienna_Conversion)
- Thermal Generators operation cost 
    - Heat rate, TwoPartCost, ThreePartCost, MarketBids?
    - ThreePartCost: Fixed cost, variable cost, and start-up cost
    - Need: start-up
            shut-down = 0 or 0.2*start_up 
    - heat rate * fuel cost
    - differenciate nuclear, thermal_st, thermal
- ~~ThermalGen time_limits (min up and down time)~~
- ~~Battery~~
- Hydro
- ~~Time series data (wind, solar, load)~~
